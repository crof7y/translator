# translator
translation program using IBM Watson's API

These programs (two contained in this repository--text2text_translator.py and speech2speech_translaor.py) have similar but different functions.

text2text_translator.py will ask for user input (a simple string) and then ask what language the user would like to translate the text to.
It will then output the translated text on the screen.

speech2speech_translator.py will take an audio file (hard coded into the code. An example file--audio.flac--has been included here for demonstration purposes.
However any audio file with a clear voice will work, as long as the audio file is in the same directory as the .py file and the 'audio.flac' gets changed 
in the code itself (as well as the file-type, which is currently set to 'audio/flac'). These potential changes are noted within the file itself with user comments.
